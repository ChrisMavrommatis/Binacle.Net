Binacle.Net is an API created to address the 3D Bin Packing Problem in real time.

When provided with a set of bins and items, Binacle.Net quickly identifies the most suitable bin,
if available, that can accommodate all items efficiently. 

This capability is particularly valuable for websites offering locker shipping options, allowing them to present 
this choice to customers during critical stages, such as the cart or checkout process.

By employing heuristic algorithms, Binacle.Net ensures rapid responses and minimal wait times for customers. 
E-commerce platforms can leverage this API to either base their packaging on the dimensions of the lockers themselves 
or utilize pre-defined boxes designed to fit seamlessly within those lockers.
