## ServiceModule

- `api/src/Binacle.Net.ServiceModule/Services/ApiUsageRateLimitingPolicy.cs:34`
  Review JSON config for default rate limit policies (anonymous, subscription tiers).

- `api/src/Binacle.Net.ServiceModule/v0/Endpoints/AccountBindingResult.cs:57`
  The "no request body" path returns a raw `ProblemDetails`. Should be a proper typed response.
