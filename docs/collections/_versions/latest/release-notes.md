## 🔎 Overview
- **Service Module** was completely rewritten with new core business logic, breaking all existing integrations.
- **V1 endpoints** were removed.
- **V3 endpoints** were promoted from experimental to stable.
- **Algorithms** were improved, primarily impacting V3 endpoints.
- **Packing Logs** were updated, with some breaking changes for existing integrations.
- **API documentation** now follows the OpenAPI 3.0 specification.
- The project introduces **versioned documentation** with an official site.

## ⚙️ Core Changes
- Removal of all V1 endpoints.
- V3 endpoints are now stable and fully supported.
- Documentation migrated to the OpenAPI 3.0 specification (may affect users relying on the old format).
- Swagger UI upgraded to OpenAPI 3.0.
- Added support for **Scalar UI**.

## 🧪 Diagnostics Module
- Packing Logs removed **legacy fitting** and **legacy packing** modes.
- These have been consolidated into **packing** and **fitting**.
- Implementations depending on the old paths must be updated.
- The default log path changed.

## 🔌 Service Module
The **Service Module** was entirely rewritten and its business logic has been fundamentally changed.

- Originally designed to power **Binacle.Net as a Service**, the module will now be developed exclusively for that use case.
- While it remains part of the open-source project (and can still be self-hosted), **no public documentation will be provided**.
- This change reduces maintenance overhead and ensures focus remains on the core hosted product.

For additional details, see the [Service Module documentation]({% vlink configuration/service-module/index.md %}).

## 🎨 UI Module
- Vendor libraries are now bundled directly into the image rather than loaded from a CDN.
- Includes various fixes and general UI improvements.

## 📈 Algorithms
- Enhanced performance for **BFD** and **WFD** algorithms.

## 🏗️ Internal Work
- Migrated testing framework to **XUnit v3**.
- Renamed project structure from *Binacle.Net.Api* to simply *Binacle.Net*.

## 📚 Versioned Docs
- Launched an official documentation site, replacing the GitHub Wiki.
- Documentation is now properly versioned, preserving older versions for reference.
- Older versions will be gradually removed as they become obsolete. 

## 🛠️ Migration Guide
To upgrade to **v2.0.0**, follow these steps:

1. **Remove all V1 usage**
    - Any calls to V1 endpoints must be removed or migrated.

2. **Review log configuration**
    - All logs under `/app/data/logs` now use the `yyyyMMdd.ndjson` format instead of `log-yyyyMMdd.txt`.

3. **Switch to V2 or V3 endpoints**
    - Update integrations to use stable V2 or V3 endpoints.
    - Verify that algorithms behave correctly with the updated logic.

4. **Update Packing Logs usage**
    - Replace any use of `legacy-fitting` and `legacy-packing` in `/app/data/pack-logs` with the new `packing` and `fitting` paths.

5. **Service Module users**
    - All integrations with the old Service Module will no longer work.
    - No public documentation is available — please contact directly if needed.
    - For self-hosted setups, you will need to rely on the source code, as documentation will not be provided.

6. **Adopt new documentation**
    - If you previously relied on the legacy JSON documentation, migrate to OpenAPI 3.0.
    - Use Swagger UI or Scalar UI for interactive references.
