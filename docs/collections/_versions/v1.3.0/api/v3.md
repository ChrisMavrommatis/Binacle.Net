## 🔌 Endpoints

### 📦 Pack by Custom
`POST /api/v3/pack/by-custom` <br>
📡 **Request**: Provide a list of bins and items, along with the desired algorithm to be used for packing. <br>
📩 **Returns**: The API performs the Packing function and returns results for each bin in the request, including specific locations for each item. <br>

## 📦 Packing Parameters
The Pack endpoints accepts the following parameters:
- **Algorithm**: Select the packing algorithm to use.

## 🧠 Available Algorithms:
- ⚖️ **FFD** (First Fit Decreasing)
- ⚠️ **WFD** (Worst Fit Decreasing)
- ⚠️ **BFD** (Best Fit Decreasing)
