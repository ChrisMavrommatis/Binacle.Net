## 🔑 User Management Rules
- ✔️ Admin users are the only ones who can manage other users, including creation, deletion, activation, 
deactivation, and promotion/demotion.
- ✔️ Only active users can interact with the API without rate limits.
- ✔️ Delete performs a soft-delete and ensures the user remains in the database but cannot interact with the API. 
 Once soft-deleted, the user cannot be restored.
- ✔️ A new user with the same email can be created after a soft-deletion.

## 📧 Email and Password Requirements
To maintain security and consistency, the following requirements must be met:

- **Email**: Must be a valid email format. It will not be used for communication or marketing purposes.
- **Password**: Must be at least 10 characters long.

## 🔒 Recommended Practice: Creating a New Admin
For enhanced security, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Admin User**: After the Service Module is configured and the default admin is set, create a new user account and promote it to admin status.
2. **Deactivate the Default Admin**: Once a new admin is established, deactivate the default admin account. This reduces the risk of exposing default credentials and enhances system security.
