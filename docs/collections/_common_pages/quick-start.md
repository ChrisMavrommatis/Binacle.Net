Getting started with Binacle.Net is simple.
Run it locally using Docker or deploy it to the cloud with minimal setup.

The default setup includes **Swagger UI** and the **UI Module** for easy testing and interaction.

For version-specific details, see the dedicated **Quick Start Guide** in the documentation.

## 🖥️ Run Locally with Docker
